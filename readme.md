# FricSense

This is a python module and some scripts for interfacing with the FricSense sensor.
The package can be imported and used as a library directly, or there are two scripts
that can be run as is for either data collection (`fricsense-read`) or data extraction
(`fricsense-process`). Call either function with the `-h` flag to see how to use them.
